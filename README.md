##Comments

I felt that this was a good easing in to creating a responsive design site on our own. Much to my surprise, the whole process of creating a basic responsive site from scratch went fairly smoothly.

The overall aesthetics of the brand is meant to be kid friendly and simple, with a nod to cheesy sci-fi movies from the 1950s. I felt that this went well with the already established Pizza Planet visuals from Toy Story but was not a direct copy.

I ended up switching my the hover effect on my submit button back to it's original state rather than having it expand in size. The "Toppings" button is meant to be a navigational element, so I felt that have a hover effect on that might be a little overkill in the final design. I may add one later, though.

After watching the presentations, I decided to create a few additional graphics to go with overall style of the site. On the assignment sheet it stated that we were to use two-three visuals, but I included four. I hope that's ok.

Once again, thank you for your thorough checking and detailed feedback. I really appreciate it.
